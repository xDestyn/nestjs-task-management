NestJS is a Node.js back-end development framework built upon Express, leveraging the power of TypeScript.

NestJS leverages the incredible popularity and robustness of JavaScript as a language and Node.js as a technology. It is inspired by common libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue which improve developer productivity and experience.

Even considering the amount of superb libraries, helpers and tools that exist for server-side Node.js, none of them effectively solve the main problem - the architecture of an application.

NestJS provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications.

Recently, the NestJS framework is gaining extreme popularity due to its incredible features:

    Leverages TypeScript - strongly typed language which is a super-set of JavaScript

    Simple to use, easy to learn and easy to master

    Powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that boosts productivity and ease of development

    Detailed, well-maintained documentation

    Active codebase development and maintenance

    Open-source (MIT license)

    Supports dozens nest-specific modules that help you easily integrate with common technologies and concepts such as TypeORM, Mongoose, GraphQL, Logging, Validation, Caching, Websockets and much more

    Easy of unit-testing applications

    Made for Monoliths and Micro-services (entire section in the documentation regarding the Microservice type of a NestJS application, as well as techniques and recipes).
